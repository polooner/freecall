# freecall - An Open Source library way for meeting bots, on any platform.

## What is freecall?

freecall is a library that allows you to easily create meeting bots that work on any platform.
The goal is to make a widely accessible library that can be used to create meeting bots which are enabled
to make use of every detail of the platform they are running on - including all the basics such as audio,
transcription, and recaps.

## How is freecall different from other meeting bot libraries?

I am hoping to make freecall the most widely accessible meeting bot library, that is actively maintained.
But my main goal is to make it the first widely available way to have realtime video and audio streams
that bots can make use of.

## Why realtime video and audio streams?

This is a problem I came up with when I was working on a project that required a meeting bot to get realtime
data, utilized by a Hugging Face model. There is no way to do this! But there will be, with freecall.
